# small-python-projects
small projects I created to learn some python

### available projects
the projects are in order of creation date\
some projects have a README that you can read\
updates don't change the order\
if you want to execute a script, and it has some libraries, install them with :
```shell
py -m pip install -r "./<project>/requirements.txt"
```
all projects have been tested with python 3.10
